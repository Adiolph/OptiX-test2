# An OptiX program for ray-tracing in neutrino telescope

This program is mainly refered to [Opticks](https://bitbucket.org/simoncblyth/opticks/src/master/).

It aims to read charged particle steps from CORSIKA 8 (an cascade simulation program), produce and propagate Cherenkov photons, test photon intersection with detector units of neutrino telescope.

## TODO

- add genstep_buffer.

- use curand to process random process.
